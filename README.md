# Image-Restoration-through-RL
Image restoration model that can handle an image affected by a mixture of distortions using Deep Reinforcement learning.

Project inspired from [Crafting a Toolchain for Image Restoration by Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03312)

Built on top of [RL-Restore](https://github.com/yuke93/RL-Restore) and [DQN-tensorflow](https://github.com/devsisters/DQN-tensorflow).
